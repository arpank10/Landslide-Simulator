/*
 * Module Name : HeadMovementControl
 * Author : Arpan Konar
 * Date created :15/04/2018
 * Synopsis : This class is a part of head movement control module. 
 *            This enables the person to walk in the virtual world based on an a particular angle.
 *Function Supported : Start() initializes the controller and gets the corresponding controller attached 
 		      with the camera.
		      Update() sets the update in the criteria for head movement, i.e., moving the person 
		      in forward direction with the defined speed.
* variables : ANGLELIMITAFTERWHICHPERSONSTARTSWAKING  (defined head angle value serving a criteria
		for walking of person.This is defined as private as it should not be changed by other functions.)
	      SPEEDOFTHEWALKINGPERSON  (defined speed of movement of person.private variable)
	      shouldThePersonBeWalking  (boolean variable for walking condition check)
